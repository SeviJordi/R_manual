# R_manual

---

This is a repository for the R manual that I am writing. The manual is intended to be a comprehensive guide to R programming, and will be written in a way that is accessible to beginners. The manual will be written in R Markdown, and will be compiled to a html document. The manual will be divided into chapters, with each chapter covering a different aspect of R programming. The manual will be updated regularly, and will be available for free download from this repository.
