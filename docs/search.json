It provides a wide range of functions and packages for conducting statistical tests, modeling data, and exploring relationships between variables. In this section, we’ll cover some basic statistical analysis techniques using R.\n\n\nDescriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. R provides several functions for calculating descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quantiles.\nLet’s calculate some descriptive statistics for the iris dataset.\n\n# Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, variance, range, and \n#  quantiles for Sepal.Length\n\n1mean(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\n2median(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\n3sd(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\n4var(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\n5range(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\n6quantile(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\n7summary(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\n\n1\n\nMean: The average value of the variable.\n\n2\n\nMedian: The middle value of the variable.\n\n3\n\nStandard deviation: A measure of the spread of the data.\n\n4\n\nVariance: The square of the standard deviation.\n\n5\n\nRange: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n\n6\n\nQuantiles: Values that divide the dataset into parts.\n\n7\n\nSummary: A summary of the main descriptive statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis testing is used to make inferences about populations based on sample data. The most common tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.\n\n\nThe t-test is implemented in R with the t.test function. A t-test compares the means of two groups to determine if they are statistically different from each other. There are two types of t-tests: one-sample t-test and two-sample t-test.\nThe one-sample t-test checks if the mean of a sample is significantly different from a known value (e.g., the population mean).\n\n# One-sample t-test\n# Check if the mean Sepal.Length is significantly different from 5.8\nt.test(iris$Sepal.Length, mu = 5.8)\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  iris$Sepal.Length\nt = 0.64092, df = 149, p-value = 0.5226\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 5.8\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 5.709732 5.976934\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 5.843333 \n\n\nThe output of the t-test includes the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value. The p-value indicates the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the null hypothesis should be rejected. The null hypothesis in this case for the t-test is that the means are nos different.\nThe confidence interval can be set with the conf.level parameter. By default, it is set to 0.95. It indicates the probability that the true mean lies within the interval.\nThe two-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups. It is used to determine if the means of two groups are significantly different from each other.\n\n# Two-sample t-test\n# Check if the mean Sepal.Length is significantly different to the mean of \n#  Sepal.Width\nt.test(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  iris$Sepal.Length and iris$Sepal.Width\nt = 36.463, df = 225.68, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 2.63544 2.93656\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 5.843333  3.057333 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nPerform a one-sample t-test to check if the mean Sepal.Width is significantly different from 3.15.

It is implemented in R with the chisq.test function.\nThe chi-square test returns the chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the null hypothesis should be rejected.

The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation. In R, the correlation coefficient can be calculated with the cor function. To test if the correlation is statistically significant, the cor.test function can be used. It returns the correlation coefficient, p-value, and confidence interval. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the correlation is statistically significant.\n\n# Calculate the correlation between Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width in the \n#  iris dataset\n\n1corelation &lt;- cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length)\nsprintf(\"The correlation coefficient is %f\", corelation)\n\n# Is significant?\n2test &lt;- cor.test(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length)\nsprintf(\"The p-value is %f\", test$p.value)\n\n\n1\n\nGet the correlation coefficient.\n\n2\n\nTest if the correlation is significant.\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"The correlation coefficient is 0.871754\"\n[1] \"The p-value is 0.000000\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nUsing the data from the bd_students.csv, calculate the correlation between the math and science grades.

It is used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable. In R, linear regression can be performed using the lm function.\n\n# Fit a linear regression model to predict Sepal.Length from Petal.Length\nmodel &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = iris)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1.24675 -0.29657 -0.01515  0.27676  1.00269 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the independent variable is a significant predictor of the dependent variable.\nFor the linear model that we just made, the p-value is 1.0386674^{-47}. This means that the Petal.Length is a significant predictor of the Sepal.Length. Also is important to see the r-squared value, that is 0.7599546, that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nUsing the data from the bd_students.csv, fit a linear regression model to predict the math grade from the science grade.

    "text": "Hypothesis testing is used to make inferences about populations based on sample data. The most common tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.\n\n\nThe t-test is implemented in R with the t.test function. A t-test compares the means of two groups to determine if they are statistically different from each other. There are two types of t-tests: one-sample t-test and two-sample t-test.\nThe one-sample t-test checks if the mean of a sample is significantly different from a known value (e.g., the population mean).\n\n# One-sample t-test\n# Check if the mean Sepal.Length is significantly different from 5.8\nt.test(iris$Sepal.Length, mu = 5.8)\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  iris$Sepal.Length\nt = 0.64092, df = 149, p-value = 0.5226\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 5.8\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 5.709732 5.976934\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 5.843333 \n\n\nThe output of the t-test includes the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value. The p-value indicates the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the null hypothesis should be rejected. The null hypothesis in this case for the t-test is that the means are nos different.\nThe confidence interval can be set with the conf.level parameter. By default, it is set to 0.95. It indicates the probability that the true mean lies within the interval.\nThe two-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups. It is used to determine if the means of two groups are significantly different from each other.\n\n# Two-sample t-test\n# Check if the mean Sepal.Length is significantly different to the mean of \n#  Sepal.Width\nt.test(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  iris$Sepal.Length and iris$Sepal.Width\nt = 36.463, df = 225.68, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 2.63544 2.93656\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 5.843333  3.057333 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nPerform a one-sample t-test to check if the mean Sepal.Width is significantly different from 3.15.

It is implemented in R with the chisq.test function.\nThe chi-square test returns the chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the null hypothesis should be rejected.

The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation. In R, the correlation coefficient can be calculated with the cor function. To test if the correlation is statistically significant, the cor.test function can be used. It returns the correlation coefficient, p-value, and confidence interval. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the correlation is statistically significant.\n\n# Calculate the correlation between Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width in the \n#  iris dataset\n\n1corelation &lt;- cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length)\nsprintf(\"The correlation coefficient is %f\", corelation)\n\n# Is significant?\n2test &lt;- cor.test(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length)\nsprintf(\"The p-value is %f\", test$p.value)\n\n\n1\n\nGet the correlation coefficient.\n\n2\n\nTest if the correlation is significant.\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"The correlation coefficient is 0.871754\"\n[1] \"The p-value is 0.000000\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nUsing the data from the bd_students.csv, calculate the correlation between the math and science grades.

It is used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable. In R, linear regression can be performed using the lm function.\n\n# Fit a linear regression model to predict Sepal.Length from Petal.Length\nmodel &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = iris)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1.24675 -0.29657 -0.01515  0.27676  1.00269 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the independent variable is a significant predictor of the dependent variable.\nFor the linear model that we just made, the p-value is 1.0386674^{-47}. This means that the Petal.Length is a significant predictor of the Sepal.Length. Also is important to see the r-squared value, that is 0.7599546, that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nUsing the data from the bd_students.csv, fit a linear regression model to predict the math grade from the science grade. Is the relationship statistically significant? How much is the proportion of variance of the math grade explained by the science grade?.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeviJordi/R_manual/refs/heads/main/data/bd_students.csv\")\n\n1model &lt;- lm(math ~ science, data = data)\nsum &lt;- summary(model)\n\n# Is the relationship significant?\n2sprintf(\"The p-value is %f\", sum$coefficients[2,4])\n\n# How much of the variance in the math grade is explained by the science grade?\n3sprintf(\"The proportion of variance explained is %f\", sum$r.squared)\n\n\n1\n\nFit a linear regression model to predict the math grade from the science grade.\n\n2\n\nThe p-value is less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis that the science grade is not a significant predictor of the math grade.\n\n3\n\nThe proportion of variance explained is 0.64, which means that 64% of the variance in the math grade is predictable from the science grade.\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"The p-value is 0.000000\"\n[1] \"The proportion of variance explained is 0.644428\"",

    "text": "Data visualization is one of the most powerful ways to communicate your data insights. R has several options for creating visualizations, from base R graphics to advanced plotting libraries like ggplot2. In this section, we’ll focus on the ggplot2 package, which provides a flexible, powerful, and elegant system for creating visualizations. ggplot2 is part of the tidyverse package, so you can load it by loading the tidyverse package. See the ggplot2 cheat sheet here.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nThe basic structure of a ggplot2 plot consists of three main components:\n\nData: The dataset you want to visualize.\nAesthetics: The mapping between variables in the data and visual properties of the plot (e.g., x-axis, y-axis, color, size).\nGeometries: The geometric objects that represent the data in the plot (e.g., points, lines, bars).\n\nWe are going to run some examples using the iris dataset, which is included in R by default.\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Load the tidyverse package\n\n1p &lt;- ggplot(iris) +\n2  aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length) +\n3  geom_point()\n\n4p\n\n\n1\n\nThe ggplot() function initializes a ggplot object.\n\n2\n\nThe aes() function specifies the aesthetics of the plot. In this case, we map the Sepal.Length variable to the x-axis and the Petal.Length variable to the y-axis.\n\n3\n\nThe geom_point() function adds points to the plot.\n\n4\n\nThe plot is stored in the variable p, and we print it to the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can customize the plot by changing the labs. The labs() function is used to set the titles of the plot and axes.\n\np = p + labs(title = \"Scatter plot of Sepal.Length vs. Petal.Length\",\n         x = \"Sepal Length\",\n         y = \"Petal Length\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theme of the plot can be customized using the theme() function. There are some buiders themes in ggplot2, like theme_minimal(), theme_light(), theme_dark(), theme_classic(), theme_void(), and theme_bw().\n\np &lt;- p + theme_bw()\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can add more variables to the plot, adding Species as the color of the dots.\n\np &lt;- p + aes(color = Species)\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, use the bd_students dataset. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeviJordi/R_manual/refs/heads/main/data/bd_students.csv.\n\nExplore the data and undesrtand the variables.\ncreate a bar plot for the stu_group variable. Do you see any problem with the data? Try to fix it.\nCreate a scatter plot for the english and math variables. Are those variables correlated? Can you obseve any clusters in the data?

    "text": "To start working with data in R, you need to import it into the R environment. R supports a wide range of file formats for data import, including CSV, Excel, and databases. You can also export data from R to different file formats.\n\n\nYou can import data into R using functions like read.csv(), read.table(). Here’s an example of importing a CSV file:\n\n# Import data from a CSV file\n# Daca can come from the internet or local files\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeviJordi/R_manual/refs/heads/main/data/iris.csv\")\n\n1head(data)\n\n\n1\n\nThe head() function displays the first few rows of the data.
